# Fit Click

This is the submission for final project at Lighthouse Labs' Web Bootcamp
(September 16, 2019 cohort) for the following students:

* John Barratt
* Jake Fantin
* Fabio Papa

We came up with this project after rejecting many other ideas, because we feel
that it strikes a good balance between technical challenges and being able to
put to use many of the technologies we learned during the bootcamp.
